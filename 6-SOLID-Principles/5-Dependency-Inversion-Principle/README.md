# Dependency Inversion Principle
> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
>
> Abstractions should not depend on details.
> 
> Details should depend on abstractions.
> 
> Don't directly depend on concrete classes.
> Depend on interfaces, and let someone else inject the implementation.
